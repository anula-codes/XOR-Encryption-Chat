# XOR-Encryption-Chat
Encrypt and decrypt messages using XOR cipher

How it works:
1. Type your message and click "Encrypt & Send"
2. Message is encrypted using XOR cipher with your key
3. Encrypted data is shown in hex format (simulating server encryption)
4. Message is automatically decrypted to verify the process

Note: This simulates the client-server interaction in the browser. In the actual C application, the server performs the encryption.
